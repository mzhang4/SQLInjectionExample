Overview:
-------------------------

This project is used to how demonstrate SQL Injection works.
To demonstrate SQL Injection, we do not use the python API, instead we generate our SQL Statement by placeholders.
To defense against SQL Injection, we can USE python API, instead of the first method.
Both two functions are implmented under model.py.
